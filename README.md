Generally speaking, permeability is the ability of a molecule to cross a membrane. In the body, key membranes exist in the intestine and brain, and are composed of layers of molecules and proteins organized in a way to prevent harmful substances from crossing while allowing essential substances to pass through. The intestine, for instance, allows substances such as nutrients to pass from the gut into the blood stream. Another membrane, the blood-brain barrier, prevents detrimental substances from crossing the blood stream into the central nervous system. 

While a molecule may have the correct characteristics to be effective against a specific disease or condition, it may not have the correct characteristics to pass from the gut into the blood stream or from the blood stream into the central nervous system. Therefore, if a potentially effective compound is not permeable, then its effectiveness may be compromised. Because a compound’s permeability status is critically important to its success, pharmaceutical companies would like to identify poorly permeable compounds as early as possible in the discovery process. 

The work done shared here shows how to build a predictive model of permeability status of the compounds present in the given data set named **“permy”** using SAS Enterprise Guide.
It also shows the comparison of different methods applied and which method gives better efficiency for the predictive model building in this case.
